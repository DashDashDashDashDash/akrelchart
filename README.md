A project that hopes to aggregate all official information about character interactions in Arknights, both inside and outside the game.

Currently in a **very-early "beta"**: the website is decently functional, but there is barely any data on it yet.

Website written in raw JavaScript, with two libraries:
- [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/)
- [Fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io/)

## Contributing

Right now, the database is not filled with a lot of information, but in the meantime you can contribute (or just hop in and say hi) through the [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/K5EKm6YFC3).

The site is supposed to be ran by administrators, similar to a wiki, but edits aren't allowed without an administrator account.
